title: Project presentation | My Smart Home Solution - Part 1
---

I want to start my blog with the presentation of my self made Smart Home Solution I'm working in my spare time. In part 1 of this series I'll give you a general overview of my solution.

# Motivation
TBD

# Screenshots
Because images says more than a thousand words let's start with screenshots. 
Please note that I have blackened the parts containing the sensitive information and pictures from my cameras.

## Dashboard - Camera

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Screenshot_Smart_Home_Web_App_1.png)
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Screenshot_Smart_Home_Web_App_2.png)

Key Features
- Activate specific camera scene and object detection (person only) with one click.
- In case of a person is detected on a picture you'll receive an email with attached pictures (person is sourrounded with a blue box and percentage probability of the model on each person detected in the image)
- Based on the selected camera scene also the radiators are switched accordingly in the background

## Dashboard - Alarm
