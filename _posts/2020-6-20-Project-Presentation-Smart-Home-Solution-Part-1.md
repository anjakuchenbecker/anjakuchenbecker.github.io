I want to start my blog with the presentation of my self made Smart Home Solution I'm working in my spare time. In part 1 of this series I'll give you a general overview of my solution. 

# Screenshots
Because images says more than a thousand words let's start with screenshots. 
Please note that I have blackened the parts containing the sensitive information and pictures from my cameras.
