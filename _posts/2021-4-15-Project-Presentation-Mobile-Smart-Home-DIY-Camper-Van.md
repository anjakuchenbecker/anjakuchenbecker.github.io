title: Project presentation | "Mobile Smart Home" for our DIY Camper Van
---

Please check out my recently started project:

[https://github.com/anjakuchenbecker/mobile_smart_home_diy_camper_van](https://github.com/anjakuchenbecker/mobile_smart_home_diy_camper_van/)

In this repo I provide my concepts and some code snippets about our DIY camper van that I will turn into a "Mobile Smart Home" with an Arduino Mega and a bunch of electronic components.

Besides the Arduino Mega I plan in addition to install a Raspberry PI with a nice touch screen which communicates with the Arduino Mega.
