Hi, my name is Anja Kuchenbecker and I'm Data Science, Machine Learning and Smart Home addicted :) 
Loving Python as well as Web Coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). 

When I'm not doing nerd stuff? #braap!

### Bio
- Over 12 years professional IT experience. 
- My love of computers and coding is explained by a statement by my brother, when I was 11 years old he said to me that **"women have no idea about computers"**. Since that day I started my IT passion. One year later I've showed him that his statement is not longer true ;-)
